## Resources

[Verilog](https://verilog.com/) is a Hardware Description Language(HDL) used to design and document electronic systems. Verilog HDL allows designers to design at various levels of abstraction.

[SystemVerilog](https://www.systemverilog.io/) is an extension of Verilog with many of the verification features that allow engineers to verifythe design using complex testbench structures and random stimuli in simulation.
